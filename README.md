Are you seeking a contributor and problem solver with resourceful UX knowledge and high-end coding skills? Here I am.

I am a results-oriented software engineer who specializes in helping businesses become more memorable, impactful, and profitable by developing cutting-edge digital products. I enjoy creating intuitive and dynamic user experiences, love writing code, and welcome the opportunity to bring my enthusiasm and skills to your next project!

I design and build beautiful applications for businesses around the globe. Iâ€™m good at thinking abstractly and putting together systems with many moving parts. I have worked both on developing projects from scratch as well as taking over existing codebases, using a variety of programming languages and frameworks. Over the years, I've specialized in producing simple yet meaningful user-centered applications.

I am familiar with working on deadlines, and I bring professionalism, communication, and great attention to detail to projects. I take an interactive approach to projects, which includes sketching, wireframes, and prototyping, to continually ensure that the application being built matches the requirements. I believe in collaborative, test-driven development.

Working with people from diverse backgrounds has provided me with a deep understanding and awareness of differences in both individuals and organizations, which is why I strongly believe that we can easily be a good fit.
