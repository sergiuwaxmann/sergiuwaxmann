Are you seeking a contributor and problem solver with resourceful UX knowledge and high-end coding skills? Here I am.

I am a result-oriented software engineer who specialises in helping businesses become more memorable, impactful and profitable by developing cutting-edge digital products. I enjoy creating intuitive and dynamic user experiences, love writing code, and welcome the opportunity to bring my enthusiasm and skills to your next project!

I design and build beautiful applications for businesses around the globe. I'm good at thinking abstractly and putting together systems with many moving parts. I have worked both developing projects from scratch as well as taking over existing codebases, using a variety of programming languages and frameworks. Over the years I've specialised in producing simple yet meaningful user-centered applications.

I am familiar with working on deadline and I bring professionalism, communication, and great attention to detail to projects. I am taking an interactive approach to projects which includes sketching, wireframes and prototyping, so that we are continually ensuring that the application being built is the application intended. I believe in collaborative, test-driven development.

Working with people from diverse backgrounds has provided me with a deep understanding and awareness of differences in both individuals and organizations, reason why I strongly believe that we can easily be a good fit.

### Are you minding a project? Letâ€™s talk.
